I abandoned the porject in april 2024 because the project was quite ambitious also required so much work to be done to launch in the very competive market among big design tools, then i started building the small app 'keystro' with friend Damy. <br/> <br/> Craftor is first abandon project and it will allways be the best app i ever built, I built this app in public you can check out the journey of building & demo videos on this official twitter account i made for Craftor app [hit the visit button below].",
