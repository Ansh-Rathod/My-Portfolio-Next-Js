              Over the years, There are many debates or Beginners questioning on
              whether React Native is best or flutter? I am here to answer none
              of your questions. it was clickbait to get you here, Go touch
              grass you computer nerd, cut down the internet for a day and eat
              ice creem it&apos;s better than posting memes on twitter thats
              what my mom said. and about the switching framework i just use
              flutter why would i spend more time learning new framework, jsx
              syntex are bad and has horrible dev exprience with typescript type
              errors eww, if google kills flutter one day i dont care! we all
              will laugh and will make more memes to share on twitter and we all
              can go back to writing html css. in the end, having fun is all
              that matters.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">
              React Native&apos;s is the best (maybe)
            </h2>

            <p>
              if you wanna build a app choose react native, if you wanna have
              fun cho0se flutter, if you wanna make money lets share memes on
              twitter, i chose twitter that why im writing and yeah i built
              desktop app using flutter(i dont care about tech stack you
              shouldnt too) called{" "}
              <Link href={"https://pimosa.app"} className="text-blue-500">
                <span className="text-blue-400 cursor-pointer">
                  Pimosa it&apos;s all in one media tool kit buy now it is
                  useful tool
                </span>
              </Link>{" "}
              if flutter dies i dont care I&apos;m learning game dev, building
              UI is boring now after doing it for the 4 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              My belief is that make money by giving value to users and have
              fun, generally i like building so i dont care about the tech
              stack, i just want to build something that will be useful to
              users. dont get attached to these frameworks its just zeros and
              onezies, 2030 nope i wont be using it, or will i? maybe not maybe
