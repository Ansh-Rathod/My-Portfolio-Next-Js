# Do not use these desktop apps.

I do not use these desktop apps. Only because these apps are built using Electron and if you research a little or experience using activity manager, these apps eat too much RAM. And I daily work with simulators, multiple docker containers at the same time which requires efficient usage of the RAM.

- WhatsApp
- Notion
- Discord
- MS Teams
- Slack
- ClickUp
- Canva

But I still use these because of the limitations of their web apps.

- VS Code
- Postman
- Figma

If you donâ€™t work with heavy tasks or have more efficient RAM than 16 GB you can ignore it, simply else avoid using them on your desktop.

Instead, use their web app.
