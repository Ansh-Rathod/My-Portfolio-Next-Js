# Are you a Flutter developer? and getting strange errors?

Things you should do before giving up when you get strange bugs.

- Flutter clean & run again
- Taking a break and thinking afresh works fine sometimes in general for all developers.
- Ask chatGPT (can provide answers to basic fundamental things)
- Check for similar issues on StackOverflow.
- Double-check that your dart-side code isn't wrong.
- Try to run it on a different platform.
- Try changing the flutter channel.
- Copy the lib folder to the new project & run (if the project was created using the old Flutter version)
- Create an issue on the flutter GitHub or ask on the discord server.

Still, a bug isn’t fixed? then sorry, I can’t help you.
