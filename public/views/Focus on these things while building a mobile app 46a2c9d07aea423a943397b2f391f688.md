# Focus on these things while building a mobile app.

On these things, I focus most as a Flutter developer while building a mobile app:

- Good UI (Always)
- Clean architecture (Code should be readable and must be following best practices)
- Using fewer pub packages (I’m having some mercy on your future self)
- The smoothness of the app on low ram devices.
- Notifications (For Don’t let people forget that they have installed our app.)
- Analytics (must need to improve the app)
- Localization (providing only English is not fine)
- Support Page (easy query/bug report)
- App size (Should be average not too big).
