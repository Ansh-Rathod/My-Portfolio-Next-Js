# How to ask for help in DMs?

Things you should do when you ask for help in DMs?

Example: you are getting errors in the code.

Do this:

- give brief info what are you building.
- don't cry.
- do not ask them to write a code for you.

PEOPLE ALWAYS FORGET THIS

- Share the repository link or share your code in GitHub gist.
- also, share your logs.
