# Apis you can look up to sharpen your front-end dev skills.

Before I knew how to build my own custom APIs I used to search public APIs to sharpen my front-end skills.

here are some APIs for you.

1. TMDB API (for movies)
2. Spoonacular API (for recipes)
3. pexels/unsplash/pixabay (for stock photos)
4. Marvel comic book API
5. NASA API
