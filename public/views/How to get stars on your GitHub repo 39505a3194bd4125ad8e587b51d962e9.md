Easy! People like what they see, you have to write a good README .md file to show the value of the repository.

Add these sections to your readme file.

- Features - what are you providing through this repository to the community?
- Add screenshots - very important.
- How to contribute
- requirements (what tech did you require to build this piece of art).
- how to run.
