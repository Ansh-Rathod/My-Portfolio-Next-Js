# What do beginners with no skills do in hackathons?

I never experienced this but I have seen my team members contributing to projects like this.

- Help in a testing project.
- Finding bugs.
- Writing hardcoded data.
- Argue with developers why features are not working.
- (En/dis)courage developers about the result.
- spoofing info about what other teams are doing.
- spamming in the team WhatsApp group or discussing irrelevant matters.

The last one was good.
