            Hello! My name is <b>Ansh Rathod</b>, I&apos;m a self-taught
            full-stack developer who wrote the first line of code in the 2020
            Corona lockdown. I think I&apos;m a fast learner & implementor so I
            have tried many trendy frameworks, and languages that come and gone
            since I started.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I started for the passion and was building & completing apps like
            madmen till 2023, most of my 25+ apps are open source on my Github
            which are just <b className="text-black">hard-to-build</b> but{" "}
            <i>fun </i>
            projects (but not directly useful).
          </p>
          <br />
          {/* <p>
            Then realized that life is more than writing code and mindlessly
            gaining skills I should start earning with these skills too.
          </p> */}
          <br />
          <p>
            I always wanted to build something of my own so I started observing
            indie makers on X/Twitter [still observing] and I have learned so
            much about what kind of product would buy and actually be useful for
            a person. [well I have made all apps that are good for resume only
            till nowðŸ™ˆ you can check the list somewhere on this site].
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            As i design mine own apps and spend so much time building and
            observing i decided to build the my own product, In June 2024 I
            started building a desktop app{" "}
            <Link href="https://pimosa.app">
              <span className="text-blue-500">https://pimosa.app</span>
            </Link>{" "}
            where user will have a number of editing tools for video, photo, and
            music files in one desktop app.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I tweeted about the paid beta version of it and turned out it is
            very simple & useful for some people I ended up making $300+ in the
            first few hours of my tweet. realized &quot;Huh I made something
            good&quot;.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>This is how i started monetizing my apps.</p>
