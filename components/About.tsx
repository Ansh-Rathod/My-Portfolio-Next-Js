            Hello! My name is <b>Ansh Rathod</b>, I&apos;m a self-taught
            full-stack developer who wrote the first line of code in the 2020
            Corona lockdown. I think I&apos;m a fast learner & implementor so I
            have tried many trendy frameworks, and languages that come and gone
            since I started.
          </motion.p>
          <br />
          <motion.p variants={textUpAnimate}>
            I started for the passion and was building & completing apps like
            crazy till 2023, most of my 25+ apps are open source on my Github
            which are just <b className="text-black">hard-to-build</b> but{" "}
            <i>fun </i>
            projects (but not directly useful).
          </motion.p>
          <br />
          <motion.p variants={textUpAnimate}>
            Then realized that life is more than writing code and mindlessly
            gaining skills I should start earning with these skills too.

          <br />
          <motion.p variants={textUpAnimate}>
            I always wanted to build something of my own so I started observing
            indie makers here on X/Twitter [and still observing] and I have
            learned so much about what kind of product would buy and actually be
            useful for a person. [well I have made all useless apps till nowðŸ™ˆ
            you can check the list somewhere on this site].

          <br />

          <motion.p variants={textUpAnimate}>
            In June 2024 I started building a desktop app{" "}
            <Link href="https://pimosa.app">
              <span className="text-blue-500">https://pimosa.app</span>
            </Link>{" "}
            where user will have a number of editing tools for video, photo, and
            music files in one desktop app.
          </motion.p>
          <br />
          <motion.p variants={textUpAnimate}>
            I tweeted about the paid beta version of it and turned out it is
            very useful for some people I ended up making $300+ in the first few
            hours of my tweet. realized &quot;Huh I made something good&quot;.

            This is how i started building apps and started earning.
